# Intro

KubeSkoop is a **network diagnosis and monitoring suite for Kubernetes**, and supports multiple CNI plugins and IaaS cloud providers.

It is designed to help users quickly diagnose and troubleshoot container network problems, and provide the ability to locate and track network events.

For different network plugins and IaaS providers, KubeSkoop automatically builds network links in Kubernetes clusters, combined with eBPF's in-depth monitoring of the kernel's critical paths, to analyze common Kubernetes cluster network problems.

By analyzing link configurations and backtracking historical network anomalies, it can significantly simplify the difficulty and time consuming of diagnosing Kubernetes network problems.
