# Intro
## Overview
![overview](/img/kubeskoop_features.png)
KubeSkoop is a kubernetes networking diagnose tool for different CNI plug-ins and IaaS providers. 
KubeSkoop automatic construct network traffic graph of Pod in the Kubernetes cluster, 
monitoring and analysis of the kernel's critical path by eBPF, to resolve most of Kubernetes cluster network problems.
Significantly simplifies the difficulty of diagnosing Kubernetes networking issues.

## Key Features
### One-Shot Diagnose
* Diagnose in-cluster traffic between Pod,Service,Node and Ingress/Egress Traffic.
* Cover whole linux network stack: Socket,Bridge,Veth,Netfilter,sysctlsâ€¦
* Support IAAS network probe for cloud providers.
### In-Depth Kernel Monitor
* eBPF seamless kernel monitor
* CO-RE scripts on series kernel by BTF
* export metrics to standard Prometheus metric API
### Network Anomaly Event
* support dozens of anomy scenes recognition
* export anomy event to Grafana Loki
