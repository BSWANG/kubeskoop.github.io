# Output Format

KubeSkoop connectivity diagnose supports multiple output formats.

`dot`, `svg` and `json` are supported as output format, by using `--format` to specify which one you want to use. You can also use `--output` to specify output filename. When set output filename to `-`, it will print the result to standard output.

If none of them is specified, diagnose will print simple link info and diagnose result to standard output.

## dot
Use `dot` as the output format. For more information about `dot` syntax, please see [documentation](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html). 

This format only contains link graph, and will not contain diagnose result.

## svg
Use `svg` as the output format. `svg` are generated by `graphviz` via dot file.

This format only contains link graph, and will not contain diagnose result.

## json
Use `json` as the output format. It contains details about nodes and edges in link graph, and also contains diagnose result on them.
